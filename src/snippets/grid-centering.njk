{% set description %}

**Put down the CSS centering jokes**! This just may be the _last_ centering solution you'll ever need! Except, perhaps it's cousin that uses `place-items` vs. `place-content`, which is occasionally more appropriate.

{% endset %}

{% set css %}
.smol-centering {
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
}
{% endset %}

{% set html %}
<ul class="smol-centering">
  <li>Feeling Centered</li>
</ul>
{% endset %}
